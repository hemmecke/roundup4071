Migrating to newer versions of Roundup
======================================


0.2.x -> 0.3.x
--------------

0.3.0 introduces cookie authentication - you will need to copy the
interfaces.py file from the roundup source to your instance home to enable
authentication. If you used the classic schema, the interfaces file is in:

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/classic/interfaces.py

If you used the extended schema, the file is in:

 <roundup source>/roundup/templates/extended/interfaces.py


This release also introduces encryption of passwords in the database. To
use the encrypted passwords in your existing database, you will need to
modify your schema.

 1. Edit the dbinit.py file in your instance home directory
 1a. Around line 47 (the first code line of the open() function):

    from roundup.hyperdb import String, Date, Link, Multilink

      alter to include Password, as so:

    from roundup.hyperdb import String, Password, Date, Link, Multilink

 1b. Around line 66 (after the 'user = Class(db, "user, ' line):

                    username=String(),   password=String(),

      alter so it reads:

                    username=String(),   password=Password(),

 2. Any existing passwords in the database will remain cleartext until they
    are edited. It is recommended that at a minimum the admin password be
    changed immediately:

      roundup-admin -i <instance home> set user1 password=<new password>
