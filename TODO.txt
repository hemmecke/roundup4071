This file has been re-purposed to contain specifically the items that need
doing before the next release:

- sessions, otks and indexing in RDBMSes
- add tests for group-by-multilink so I finally implement it for the RDBMSes
- full coverage analysis for unit tests
- s/getnode/getitem in backends (and s/Node/Item)
- activity_by meta-property

- migrate to numeric ID values (fixes bug 817217)
