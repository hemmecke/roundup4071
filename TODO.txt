This file contains items that need doing before the next release:

Required:
- documentation of i18n: TAL tags for translation
- implementing logging for roundup-server, including command-line switches
- fix documentation referring to configuration (config.ini, mysql.txt and
  postgresql.txt)
- fix documentation referring to customisation using interfaces.py
- fix admin_guide referring to structure of trackers
- add config.ini section descriptions - DONE?
- review use of hasPermission etc. in classic template (check all uses,
  make sure they're appropriate, make sure anonymous has a reasonable view
  of things by default)
- REMOVE THE BSDDB* backends

Optionally:
- clean up roundup.cgi (switch to config file, use proper logging, remove
  all the crap)
- have rdbms backends look up the journal for actor if it's not set
- migrate to numeric ID values (fixes bug 817217)
- configuration editing in Web User Interface: core config,
  standalone server config, detectors and extensions configurations
- refactor backends to have a common Database class that manages them all,
  allowing different Class implementations from differen backends in the
  one tracker. Once this is done, re-work the security stuff so that the
  roles attribute is a Multlilink and the security module defines the
  roles "class".
- include the test system in the binary distributions
