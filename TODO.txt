This file has been re-purposed to contain specifically the items that need
doing before the next release:

- have rdbms backends look up the journal for actor if it's not set
- migrate rdbms backends to use typed columns
- migrate to numeric ID values (fixes bug 817217)

- ensure index creation is triggered by the version 1->2 update
  (and other upgrade tests)
