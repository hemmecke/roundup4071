This file has been re-purposed to contain specifically the items that need
doing before the next release:

- sessions, otks and indexing in RDBMSes
- add tests for group-by-multilink so I finally implement it for the RDBMSes
- s/getnode/getitem in backends (and s/Node/Item)
- have rdbms backends look up the journal for actor if it's not set
- ensure index creation is triggered by the version 1->2 update

- migrate to numeric ID values (fixes bug 817217)
