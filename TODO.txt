General Roundup project TODO list. Note that some of these are semi-formed
ideas. Those ideas that don't make the cutoff for the next major release are
punted automatically into the subsequent major release TODO.

State    Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pending  example: meta/parent bug implementation (feature request #506815)
pending  hyperdb: write a backend for gadfly
pending  hyperdb: range searching of values (dates in particular)
         - filter specifies {property: (comparison function, value)}
           comparison functions: lt, le, eq, ge, gt. eq and
           [value, value, ...] implies "in"
pending  hyperdb: make creator, creation and activity available pre-commit
pending  instance: including much simpler upgrade path and the use of
                   non-Python configuration files (ConfigParser)
pending  instance: cleanup to support config (feature request #498658)
pending  instance: split instance.open() into open() and login()
pending  instance: rename to "instance" to "tracker"
pending  instance: sanity check instance setup after all these changes
pending  mailgw: allow commands (feature request #556996)
                 like "help", "dump issue123" (would send all info about
                 issue123, including a digest of all messages, but probably
                 not all files...), "list issue", ...
pending  mailgw: Allow multiple email addresses at one gw with different default
                 classes and property values (possibly through command-line
                 args to the mailgw as invoked in the mail delivery "aliases"
                 file) eg:
                   roundup: "|roundup-mailgw /instances/dev"
                   vmbugs: "|roundup-mailgw /instances/dev component=voicemail"
pending  project: switch to a Roundup instance for Roundup bug/feature tracking
active   security: finish doc/security.txt (RJ)
pending  security: implement and use the new logical control mechanisms
pending  security: at least an LDAP user database implementation
pending  security: authenticate over a secure connection
pending  security: use digital signatures in mailgw
pending  web: I18N
pending  web: Better message summary display (feature request #520244)
pending  web: Navigating around the issues (feature request #559149)
pending  web: Re-enable link backrefs from messages (feature request #568714)
pending  web: fix double-submit by having new-item-submit redirect at end
pending  web: Quick help links next to the property labels giving a
              description of the property. Combine with help for the actual
              form element too, eg. how to use the nosy list edit box.
pending  web: feature request #507842
active   web: saving of named queries (GM)

ongoing  any bugs

done hyperdb: full-text search also search certain String properties (RJ)

done mailgw: better help message (feature request #558562) (RJ)
