This file contains items that need doing before the next release:

Required:
- documentation of i18n: TAL tags for translation
- translation databases in trackers
- implementing logging for roundup-server, including command-line switches
- per-property permission spec


Optionally:
- have rdbms backends look up the journal for actor if it's not set
- migrate to numeric ID values (fixes bug 817217)
