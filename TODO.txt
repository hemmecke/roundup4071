General Roundup project TODO list. Note that some of these are semi-formed
ideas. Those ideas that don't make the cutoff for the next major release are
punted automatically into the subsequent major release TODO.

For 0.5 release:

State    Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pending  configuration: including much simpler upgrade path and the use of
         non-Python configuration files (ConfigParser)
         instance dir: cleanup to support config
         feature request #498658
pending  meta/parent bug support/implementation
         feature request #506815
pending  user preferences
         feature request #507842
pending  rename to "instance" to "tracker"
pending  journalling: fix the journal bloat
         related: Re-enable link backrefs from messages
                  feature request #568714
pending  alternative user auth: at least an LDAP implementation
active   security overhaul: see doc/security.txt (RJ)
done     - switch to sessions for web authentication
         - authenticate over a secure connection
         - implement and use the new logical control mechanisms
         - use digital signatures in mailgw
active   implement an RDB backend (RJ)
done     - further split the *dbm backends from the core code, allowing
           easier non-dict-like backends (eg metakit, RDB)
         - write a backend for gadfly
pending  fix double-submit by having new-item-submit redirect at end
pending  split instance.open() into open() and login()
pending  range searching of values (dates in particular)
         - filter specifies {property: (comparison function, value)}
           comparison functions: lt, le, eq, ge, gt
         - eq and [value, value, ...] implies "in"
pending  switch to a Roundup instance for Roundup bug/feature tracking
pending  I18N of web interface
pending  Better web message summary display
         feature request #520244
pending  Allow commands through mail gateway
         feature request #556996
pending  better help message for mailgw
         feature request #558562
pending  Navigating around the issues
         feature request #559149
pending  Allow multiple email addresses at one mailgw, with different default
         classes and property values (possibly through command-line args to
         the mailgw as invoked in the mail delivery "aliases" file) eg:
           roundup: "|/roundup/bin/roundup-mailgw /roundup/instances/dev"
           vmbugs: "|/roundup/bin/roundup-mailgw /roundup/instances/dev component=voicemail"
pending  Quick help links on web interface next to the property labels giving
         a description of the property. Combine with help for the actual form
         element too, eg. how to use the nosy list edit box.

ongoing  any bugs

done     Have the full-text search also search certain String properties (RJ)
