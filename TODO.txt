         the mailgw as invoked in the mail delivery "aliases" file) eg:
           roundup: "|/roundup/bin/roundup-mailgw /roundup/instances/dev"
           vmbugs: "|/roundup/bin/roundup-mailgw /roundup/instances/dev component=voicemail"
pending  Quick help links on web interface next to the property labels giving
         a description of the property. Combine with help for the actual form
         element too, eg. how to use the nosy list edit box.

ongoing  any bugs

done     Have the full-text search also search certain String properties (RJ)
