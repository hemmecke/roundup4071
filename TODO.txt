This file contains items that need doing before the next release:

Required:
- documentation of i18n: TAL tags for translation
- translation databases in trackers
- implementing logging for roundup-server, including command-line switches
- per-property permission spec
- fix documentation referring to configuration (config.ini, mysql.txt and
  postgresql.txt)
- fix documentation referring to customisation using interfaces.py
- fix admin_guide referring to structure of trackers
- add config.ini section descriptions - DONE?
- review use of hasPermission etc. in classic template
- how to override Client class methods like determine_user?
- clean up roundup.cgi
- include demo.py in the binary distributions
- migrate minimal template to new layout

Optionally:
- have rdbms backends look up the journal for actor if it's not set
- migrate to numeric ID values (fixes bug 817217)
- configuration editing in Web User Interface: core config,
  standalone server config, detectors and extensions configurations
- refactor backends to have a common Database class that manages them all,
  allowing different Class implementations from differen backends in the
  one tracker
- include the test system in the binary distributions
