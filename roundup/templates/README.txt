This directory contains "templates" for installations of roundup. 

Choose a template that matches your needs most closely, then run
roundup-admin init <templatename>, then customise the new instance's 
templates.

The currently available templates are:

  classic  -- The schema is as described in the Roundup spec.

  extended -- The classic schema with some extra fields useful for support
              calls: product identification, customer name, source of call,
              log of time spent on call.
