# Revision 1.12  2002/01/14 02:20:15  richard
#  . changed all config accesses so they access either the instance or the
#    config attriubute on the db. This means that all config is obtained from
#    instance_config instead of the mish-mash of classes. This will make
#    switching to a ConfigParser setup easier too, I hope.
#
# At a minimum, this makes migration a _little_ easier (a lot easier in the
# 0.5.0 switch, I hope!)

# Features added:

#     addresses if ANONYMOUS_ACCESS is denied

# Updated some documentation.
#
# Revision 1.7  2001/10/09 07:38:58  richard
# Pushed the base code for the extended schema CGI interface back into the
# code cgi_client module so that future updates will be less painful.
# Also removed a debugging print statement from cgi_client.
