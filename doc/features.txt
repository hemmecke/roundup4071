Roundup Features
================


Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
web, e-mail and command-line interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.


*simple to use*
 - accessible through the web, email, command-line or Python programs
 - may be used to track bugs, features, user feedback, sales opportunities,
   ...
 - keeps a full history of changes to issues

*simple to install*
 - installation takes about 10 minutes for a basic installation
 - two "template" schemas included in the distribution for you to base your
   tracker on

*web interface*
 - fully editable interfaces for indexing and display of items
 - differentiates between anonymous, known and admin users
 - may be set up to require login, and may also only allow admin users
   to register new users
 - may be run through CGI as a normal cgi script, as a stand-alone
   web server, or through Zope
 - searching may be performed using many constraints, including a full-text
   search of messages attached to issues
 - file attachments (added through the web or email) are served up with the
   correct content-type and filename
 - email change messages generated by roundup appear to be sent by the
   person who made the change, but responses will go back through the nosy
   list by default (see `e-mail interface`_)

*_`e-mail interface`*
 - may be set up using sendmail-like delivery alias, POP polling or mailbox
   polling
 - issues have their own mini mailing list (nosy list)
 - may auto-register users who send in mail and aren't known to roundup
 - nosy list configuration controls how people are added and when messages
   are sent to the list
 - auto-filing of "unformatted" messages into a particular class
 - e-mail attachments are handled sanely, being attached to the issue they're
   intended for, and forwarded on to the nosy list
 - sane handling of content-type and content-encoding of messages (text/plain
   preferred in all situations)
 - email packages that display threading will show issue messages correctly
   threaded
 - users may send in messages from multiple addresses and be associated
   with the same roundup username

*command-line*
 - may be used to interactively manage roundup databases
 - may be scripted using standard shell scripting
 - roundup's API may also be used by other Python programs - a sample is
   provided that runs once a day and emails people their assigned issues

*highly configurable*
 - web interface HTML is fully editable
 - database schema is also fully editable
 - customised automatic auditors and reactors may be written that perform
   actions before and after changes are made to entries in the database
 - samples are provided for all types of configuration changes
