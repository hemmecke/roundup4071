It is with a huge sigh of relief that I announce this first beta of
Roundup version 0.7.

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

No, really, this is a BETA and if you don't follow the upgrading steps,
particularly the bit about BACKING UP YOUR DATA, I'm NOT GOING TO BE HELD
RESPONSIBLE. This release is NOT FOR GENERAL USE.

I would *greatly* appreciate people giving this release a whirl with a
copy of their existing setup. It's only through real-world testing of
beta releases that we can ensure that older trackers will be OK.

This release introduces far too many features to list here. Some
highlights:

- added postgresql backend (originally from sf patch 761740, many changes
  since)
- RDBMS backends implement their session and one-time-key stores and
  full-text indexers; thus they are now performing their own locking
  internally
- added new "actor" automatic property (indicates user who cause the last
  "activity")
- all RDBMS backends have sensible data typed columns and indexes on
  several columns
- we support confirming registration by replying to the email (sf bug
  763668)
- all HTML templating methods now automatically check for permissions
  (either view or edit as appropriate), greatly simplifying templates

Roundup requires python 2.1.3 or later for correct operation.

To give Roundup a try, just download (see below), unpack and run::

    python demo.py

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and seven database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3,
sqlite, metakit, mysql and postgresql).
