=================================================
SC-Track Roundup 0.5.0 - an issue tracking system
=================================================

Note: If you are upgrading, you *must* read doc/upgrading.txt!

Roundup requires python 2.1.1 for correct operation. Support for dumbdbm
requires python 2.1.2 or 2.2. 2.1.3 and 2.2.1 are recommended.

A lot has been done since 0.4.4:

- new backend for metakit (thanks Gordon McMillan)
- new backend for sqlite
- new backend for gadfly (it's as done as it's going to get)
- added Boolean and Number types
- fixed the journal bloat, re-enabling useful link journal events
- full-text search may also search certain String properties
- entire database export and import (including files)
- implemented new per-user access control mechanisms (Permissions, Roles)
- switched templating to use Zope's PageTemplates giving much more flexibility
- made web interface more generic, robust, give nicer errors, ...
- revamped look and feel in web interface including cleaned up CSS usage
- switched to cookie-based sessions for web authentication
- saving of named search queries
- lots of documentation cleanups including an updated customisation document
  with los of examples and a new maintenance guide
- roundup-server may be a daemon now (fork, logfile, pidfile)
- many, many more bug fixes, cleanups and minor improvements (see CHANGES.txt)

This final 0.5.0 release fixes the following problems:

- fixed style for alternating rows in user lists
- a couple of other minor bugs
- updated demo to use 0.5 codebase

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with 
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design 
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this project 
is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as 
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and six database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3, sqlite,
metakit and gadfly).
