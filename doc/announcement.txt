SC-Track Roundup 0.5.1 - an issue tracking system
=================================================

This is a bugfix release for version 0.5.0 - if you're upgrading from before
that, you *must* read doc/upgrading.txt!

Unfortunately, the Zope frontend for Roundup is currently broken. I will be
looking into fixing it for the next patch release.

Roundup requires python 2.1.3 or later for correct operation.

We've had a good crack at bugs (thanks to all who contributed!):
- fixed filter() with no sort/group (sf bug 618614)
- fixed register with no session (sf bug 618611)
- fixed log / pid file path handling in roundup-server (sf bug 617981)
- fixed old gadfly compatibiltiy problem, for sure this time (sf bug 612873)
- https URLs from config now recognised as valid (sf bug 619829)
- nicer display of tracker list in roundup-server (sf bug 619769)
- fixed some missed renaming instance -> tracker (sf bug 619769)
- allow blank passwords again (sf bug 619714)
- made form table cell alignment consistent (sf bug 621887)
- include stylesheet in docs (sf bug 623183)
- store PIPE messages so we can re-send them on errors (sf bug 623082)
- implemented "retire" cgi action, added to user index (sf bug 618612)
- included doc ideas from Bernhard Reiter (sf feature 621941)
- handle "unset" status in status auditor (sf bug 621250)
- homogenise newlines in CGI text submissions (sf bug 614072)
- merged Zope Collector #372 fix from ZPT CVS trunk
- implemented the missing Interval.__add__
- metakit cleanups
- nicer "navigation" style in index views
- highlight index rows in groups of three
- handle missing Link values in anydbm backend set() operation
- expose the tracker config as a variable for templating
- fixed history to display username instead of userid
- shipped templates didn't import all hyperdb types in dbinit.py
- fixed bug in Interval serialisation
- issues in 'done-cbb' are now also moved to 'chatting' on new messages
- added ability to implement new templating utility methods
- expose the Date.pretty method to templating

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with 
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design 
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this project 
is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as 
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and six database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3, sqlite,
metakit and gadfly).
