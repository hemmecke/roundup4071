=================================================
SC-Track Roundup 0.5.4 - an issue tracking system
=================================================

This is a bugfix release for version 0.5.x - if you're upgrading from before
0.5, you *must* read doc/upgrading.txt!

Unfortunately, the Zope frontend for Roundup is currently broken, with no
fix in the forseeable future.

Roundup requires python 2.1.3 or later for correct operation. Users of the
sqlite backend are encouraged to upgrade sqlite to version 2.7.3.

We've had a good crack at bugs (thanks to all who contributed!):

- key the templates cache off full path, not filename
- implemented whole-database locking
- hyperlinking of special text (url, email, item designator) in messages
- fixed time default in date.py
- fixed error in cgi/templates.py (sf bug 652089)
- fixed handling of missing password (sf bug 655632)
- applied patches for handling Outlook quirks (thanks Andrey Lebedev)
  (multipart/alternative, "fw" and content-type "name")
- fire auditors and reactors in rdbms retire (thanks Sheila King)
- better match for mailgw help "command" text
- handle :add: better in cgi form parsing (sf bug 663235)
- handle all-whitespace multilink values in forms (sf bug 663855)
- fixed searching on date / interval fields (sf bug 658157)
- fixed form elements names in search form to allow grouping and sorting 
  on "creation" field
- display of saved queries is now performed correctly

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with 
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design 
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this project 
is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as 
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and six database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3, sqlite,
metakit and gadfly).
