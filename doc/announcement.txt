===================================================
SC-Track Roundup 0.6.0b2 - an issue tracking system
===================================================

This is the second release of the new version of Roundup which contains a
lot of new features. This release may contain bugs, so please run this using
a backup of your production tracker. Always follow the "Software Upgrade"
guidelines given in the maintenance documentation. If you're upgrading from
an older version of Roundup you *must* read doc/upgrading.txt!

Unfortunately, the Zope frontend for Roundup is currently broken, with no
fix in the forseeable future.

The gadfly backend has now been removed, having served its purpose as a
template for other RDBMS implementations. It is replaced by the mysql
backend.

Roundup requires python 2.1.3 or later for correct operation.

This release has a couple of bufixes mostly important to Windows users,
making it possible for them to install new trackers!

The 0.6 release has lots of new goodies including:

- new instant-gratification Demo Mode ("python demo.py" :)
- added mysql backend (see doc/mysql.txt for details)
- web interface cleanups including nicer history display, nicer index
  navigation and nicer popup list windows
- searching of date ranges
- better international support, including utf-8 email handling and ability
  to display localized dates in web interface.
- more documentation including revamped design document, unix manual pages
  and some FAQ entries
- significantly more powerful form handling allowing editing of multiple items
  and creation of multiple items
- tracker templates can contain subdirectories and static files (e.g. images)
  and we may now distribute templates separately from Roundup. Template
  HTML files now have a .html extension too.
- user registration is now a two-step process, with confirmation from the email
  address supplied in the registration form, and we also have a password reset
  feature for forgotten password / login
- Windows Service mode for roundup-server when daemonification is attempted
  on Windows.
- fixed issues with dumb email or web clients
- lots more little tweaks and back-end work...
- email system handles more SMTP and POP features (TLS, APOP, ...)

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with 
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design 
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this project 
is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as 
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and six database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3, sqlite,
metakit and mysql).
