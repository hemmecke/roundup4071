SC-Track Roundup 0.5 pre-release - an issue tracking system
===========================================================

Note: This is the final pre-release of the newest version of Roundup. It is
      strongly recommended that you maintain your existing 0.4 installation if
      you have one, and run 0.5 on a copy of the database. If you are
      upgrading from 0.4, you must read doc/upgrading.txt!

Roundup requires python 2.1.1 for correct operation. Support for dumbdbm
requires python 2.1.2 or 2.2. 2.1.3 and 2.2.1 are recommended.

This release fixes the following specific problems:

- fixes to import/export
- password edit now has a confirmation field
- cleanups and fixes to the shipped classic template
- new backend for sqlite (and it rocks :)
- many performance improvements in dbm and sql backends
- cgi.client base URL is now obtained from the config TRACKER_WEB (as a result
  request.url has gone away - there's too much magic in trying to figure
  what it should be)
- cgi-bin script redirects to https now if the request was https
- FileClass "content" property wasn't being returned by getprops() in most
  backends
- we now verify instance attributes on instance open and throw a useful error
  if they're not all there
- sf bug 611217 ] menu() has problems when labelprop==None
- verify contents of tracker module when the tracker is opened
- fixes to value parsing from edit forms
- mailgw was missing an "import sys" (!)
- setup now installs scripts with python -O flag, doubling performance in some
  cases (there's a lot of __debug__ use)
- added getItem to HTMLClass so you can access arbitrary items in templates
- replaced the content() callback ickiness with Page Template macro usage
- changed the default CSS style to be less offensive to some ;)
- better handling of Page Template compilation errors
- sf bug 614188 ] Exception in mailgw.py
- sf bug 613310 ] traceback on onexistant items
- sf bug 613291 ] typos in nosy list
- handle stupid mailers that QUOTE their Re; 'Re: "[issue1] bla blah"'
- giving a user a Role that doesn't exist doesn't break stuff any more
- revamped user guide, customisation guide, added basic maintenance guide
- merged some bugfixes from the Zope Page Templates trunk
- added the "minimal" template

A lot has been done since 0.4:

- new backend for metakit (thanks Gordon McMillan)
- new backend for sqlite
- new backend for gadfly (it's as done as it's going to get)
- further split the dbm backends from the core code, allowing easier
  non-dict-like backends (eg metakit, RDB)
- added Boolean and Number types
- fixed the journal bloat
- full-text search may also search certain String properties
- entire database export and import (incl files)
- implemented and used the new access control mechanisms (Permissions, Roles)
- switched templating to use Zope's PageTemplates giving much more flexibility
- revamped look and feel in web interface including cleaned up CSS usage
- re-worked cgi interface to abstract out the explicit "issue" interface
- switched to sessions for web authentication
- saving of named search queries
- updated design document for new access controls
- updated customisation document, including more examples
- added maintenance guide
- better mailgw help message (feature request #558562)
- we handle "not found", access and item page render errors better
- fixed double-submit by having new-item-submit redirect at end
- roundup-server may be a daemon now (fork, logfile, pidfile)
- renamed "instance" to "tracker" everywhere, and "node" to "item" in most
  places
- many more bug fixes, cleanups and minor improvements

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with 
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design 
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this project 
is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as 
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and six database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3, sqlite,
metakit and gadfly).
