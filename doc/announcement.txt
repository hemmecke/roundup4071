=================================================
SC-Track Roundup 0.5.3 - an issue tracking system
=================================================

This is a bugfix release for version 0.5.x - if you're upgrading from before
0.5, you *must* read doc/upgrading.txt!

Unfortunately, the Zope frontend for Roundup is currently broken, with no
fix in the forseeable future.

Roundup requires python 2.1.3 or later for correct operation. Users of the
sqlite backend are encouraged to upgrade sqlite to version 2.7.3.

We've had a good crack at bugs (thanks to all who contributed!):

- added mention of how to give users multiple Roles
- mention needed trailing "/" in TRACKER_WEB
- fixed upgrading doc to have CGI changes in the correct order
- fixed double-close of anydbm backend (sf bug 639030)
- removed use of string/strop from TAL/TALInterpreter
- handle KeyboardInterrupt nicely
- fixed Date and Interval form value handling
- fixed Date.local()
- email quoted text stripping is controllable again (sf bug 650742)
- extract attachment name from content-disposition if name is missing (sf
  bug 637278)
- removed FILTER_POSITION from bundled configs
- reverse message listing in issue display (reversion of recent change)
- bad entries for multilink editing in cgi don't traceback now (sf bug 640310)
- detect and break email loops (sf bug 640854)
- finished of handling of retired flag in filter() (sf bug 635260)
- allow StringHTMLProperty in MultilinkHTMLProperty test to work
- don't set explicit None Link properties in web create
- fixed nasty sorting bug that was lowercasing properties
- allow multiple :remove and :add elements per property being edited
- added date header to emails (sf bug 651358)

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with 
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design 
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this project 
is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as 
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and six database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3, sqlite,
metakit and gadfly).
