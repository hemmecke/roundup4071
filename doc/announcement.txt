I'm proud to release this 7th major feature release of Roundup.

Version 0.7 introduces far too many features to list here so I've put
together a What's New page:

  http://roundup.sourceforge.net/doc-0.7/whatsnew-0.7.html

Some highlights:

- added postgresql backend
- trackers using postgresql or mysql backends may have many users
- new "actor" automatic property (user who caused the last "activity")
- RDBMS backends have data typed columns and indexes on several columns
- registration may be concluded by replying to the confirmation email
- HTML templating permission checks are greatly simplified
- database exports now include full journals
- IMAP support in the mail gateway

Known issues:

- the metakit import feature currently has a bug and should not be used

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

Roundup requires python 2.1.3 or later for correct operation.

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and seven database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3,
sqlite, metakit, mysql and postgresql).
