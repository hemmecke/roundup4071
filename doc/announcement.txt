This is the second beta release of Roundup version 0.7. It fixes some bugs
in the previous beta release:

- mysql and postgresql schema mutation now handle added Multilinks
- web CSV export was busted (as was any action returning a result)
- MultiMapping deviated from the Zope C implementation in a number of
  places (thanks Toby Sargeant)
- MySQL and Postgresql use BOOL/BOOLEAN for Boolean types
- OTK generation was busted (thanks Stuart D. Gathman)
- export and import now include journals (incompatible with export < 0.7)
- added "download_url" method to generate a correctly quoted URL for file
  download links (sf bug 927745)
- all uses of TRACKER_WEB now ensure it ends with a '/'
- roundup-admin install checks for existing tracker in target home
- grouping (and sorting) by multilink in RDBMS backends (sf bug 655702)
- roundup scripts may now be asked for their version (sf rfe 798657)
- sqlite backend had stopped using the global lock
- better check for anonymous viewing of user items (sf bug 933510)
- stop Interval from displaying an empty string (sf bug 934022)
- fixed storage of some datatypes in some RDBMS backends

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

No, really, this is a BETA and if you don't follow the upgrading steps,
particularly the bit about BACKING UP YOUR DATA, I'm NOT GOING TO BE HELD
RESPONSIBLE. This release is NOT FOR GENERAL USE.

I would *greatly* appreciate people giving this release a whirl with a
copy of their existing setup. It's only through real-world testing of
beta releases that we can ensure that older trackers will be OK.

Version 0.7 introduces far too many features to list here. I've put
together a What's New page:

  http://roundup.sourceforge.net/doc-0.7/whatsnew-0.7.html

Some highlights:

- added postgresql backend
- trackers using postgresql or mysql backends may have many users
- new "actor" automatic property (user who caused the last "activity")
- RDBMS backends have data typed columns and indexes on several columns
- registration may be concluded by replying to the confirmation email
- HTML templating permission checks are greatly simplified
- database exports now include full journals
- IMAP support in the mail gateway

Roundup requires python 2.1.3 or later for correct operation.

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and seven database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3,
sqlite, metakit, mysql and postgresql).
