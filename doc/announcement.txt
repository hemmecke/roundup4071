=================================================
SC-Track Roundup 0.5.2 - an issue tracking system
=================================================

This is a bugfix release for version 0.5.x - if you're upgrading from before
that, you *must* read doc/upgrading.txt!

Unfortunately, the Zope frontend for Roundup is currently broken, with no
fix in the forseeable future.

Roundup requires python 2.1.3 or later for correct operation. Users of the
sqlite backend are encouraged to upgrade sqlite to version 2.7.3.

We've had a good crack at bugs (thanks to all who contributed!):

- added quotes around python interpreter in windows bat (sf bug 623963)
- fixed link at end of installation doc (sf bug 623957)
- handle "classname" URL path errors cleaner (generate a 404)
- added CGI :remove:<propname> and :add:<propname> which specify item
  ids to remove / add in <propname> multilink.
- bugfix in boolean templating
- remember the change note on bad submissions (sf bug 625989)
- highlight required form fields (sf bug 625989)
- force non-word boundary to match re: in subject (sf bug 626303)
- handle sqlite bug (<2.7.2) (sf bug 630828)
- handle missing props in anydbm stringFind
- updated email package address formatting (deprecation)
- copied email address quoting from email v2.4.3 so we're consistent
  with 2.2
- email summary extraction now takes the first whole sentence or line -
  whichever is longer
- documented dependency on Active State (sf bug 623959)
- ensured there's no zero-length files in source (sf bug 633622)
- added ID to the search page (sf bug 631601)
- fixed filtering by id in anydbm
- show issue ID in the headings (sf bug 631598)
- show entire messages by default in issues (sf bug 625995)
- fixed journalling to save old values instead of new (sorry I took so
  long, GM)
- handle missing REQUEST_URI for cgi-bin users (sf bug 620163)

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with 
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design 
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this project 
is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as 
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and six database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3, sqlite,
metakit and gadfly).
