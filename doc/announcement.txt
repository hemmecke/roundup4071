I'm proud to release this 8th major feature release of Roundup.

First up, big thanks go to alexander smishlajev who has done some really
good work getting the i18n and new configuration components of this release
going.

Version 0.8 introduces far too many features to list here so I've put
together a What's New page:

  http://roundup.sourceforge.net/doc-0.8/whatsnew-0.8.html

Some highlights:

* i18n of the user interface (not just web),
* a re-working of the tracker home configuration to make it much cleaner,
* several speed optimisations,
* integration of the python logging module,
* optional configuration of roundup-server through a configuration file,
* creation of items check the new Create Permission rather than Edit now,
* Permissions may be defined on a per-property basis,
* Permissions may include a fragment of code to run to check, and
* a bunch of smaller feature additions... 

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

Roundup requires python 2.1.3 or later for correct operation.

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and five database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, metakit,
mysql and postgresql).
