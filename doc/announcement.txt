About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with 
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design 
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this project 
is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as 
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to
 (a) submit new issues,
 (b) find and edit existing issues, and
 (c) discuss issues with other participants.
The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.0+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates and three database back-ends.
