MySQL Backend
=============

This is notes about mysql backend for roundup issue tracker.


Prerequisites
=============

To use MySQL as backend for storing roundup data, you should additionally
install:

    1. MySQL RDBMS 3.23.34 or higher - http://www.mysql.com. Your MySQL
       installation should support Berkeley DB (BDB) tabes for transaction
       support.
    2. Python interface to mysql - http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python


How to run mysql tests?
=======================

Roundup tests expect empty database available for use. There are two ways how to
provide it:

    1. If you have root permissions on mysql server, you can create necessary
       database using this SQL sequence:

       CREATE DATABASE rounduptest
       GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON rounduptest TO rounduptest@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'rounduptest'
       FLUSH PRIVILEGES

    2. If your administrator has provided you with database connection info, you
       can modify MYSQL_* constants in test/test_db.py with corresponding
       values.

Note, that mysql database should not contain any tables. Tests will not dare to
drop database with data.
