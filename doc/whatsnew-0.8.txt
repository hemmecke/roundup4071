What's New in Roundup 0.8
=========================

For those completely new to Roundup, you might want to look over the very
terse features__ page.

Logging of internal messages
============================


Security Changes
================

Added MD5 scheme for password hiding. This extends the existing SHA and
crypt methods and is useful if you have an existing MD5 password database.


Extending Roundup
=================

To write extension code for Roundup you place a file in the tracker home
``extensions`` directory. See the `customisation documentation`_ for more
information about how this is done.


Added support for HTTP charset selection
========================================

XXX This doesn't appear in the main documentation

This is used to override the UTF-8 default. It may be overridden in both
forms and a browser cookie.

- In forms, use the ``@charset`` variable.
- To use the cookie override, have the ``roundup_charset`` cookie set.

In both cases, the value is a valid charset name (eg. ``utf-8`` or
``kio8-r``).
