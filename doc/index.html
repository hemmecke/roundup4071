<h3><a name="installing">Installing Roundup</a></h3>

<ol>
    <li>Run:
    <br><tt>python setup.py install</tt>
    <li>If you would prefer the scripts installed in somewhere other than
    <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>, add <tt>"--install-scripts=&lt;dir&gt;"</tt>
    to the command:
    <br><tt>python setup.py install --install-scripts=&lt;dir&gt;</tt>
    <li>The command:
    <br><tt>python setup.py install --help</tt>
    <br>gives all the options available for installation.
</ol>


<p><hr>
<h2><a name="starting">Getting Started</a></h2>

The following instructions assume that you have installed roundup. If you
haven't, you may still proceed - just preface all commands with "./"
ie. "./roundup-admin init".


<h3><a name="instance">The Instance</a></h3>

We'll be referring to the term "instance" a lot from now on. An instance is
a directory in your filesystem that is where all the information about a
live issue tracker database is stored. The data that is entered as issues,
the users who access the database and the definition of the database itself
all reside there:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Hyperdatabase</strong>
    <br>This is the lowest component of Roundup and is where all the
    issues, users, file attachments and messages are stored.
    <li><strong>Database schema</strong>
    <br>This describes the content of the hyperdatabase - what fields are
    stored for issues, what user information, etc. Being stored in the
    instance, this allows it to be customised for a particular application.
    It also means that changes in the Roundup core code do not affect a
    running instance.
    <li><strong>Web Interface</strong>
    <br>The web interface templates are defined in the instance too - and
    the actual CGI interface class is defined (mostly using base classes in
    the Roundup core code) so it, like the database, may be customised for
    each instance in use.
</ol>

Instances are created using the <tt>roundup-admin</tt> tool.

<h3><a name="startcmd">Command Line Tool</a></h3>

To initiliase a new instance, run <tt>roundup-admin init</tt>. You will be
asked a series of questions:

<ol>
    <li>Instance home directory
    <li>Schema to use
    <li>Database back-end to use
    <li>Administration user "admin" password.
</ol>

Roundup is configurable using a localconfig.py file in the instance home.
It may have the following variable declarations:
  
<ol>
    <li>MAILHOST
    <br>The SMTP mail host that roundup will use to send mail
    <li>MAIL_DOMAIN
    <br>The domain name used for email addresses
</ol>

Any further configuration should be possible by editing the instance home's
__init__.py directly.
<p>
The email addresses used by the system by default are:

<ol>
    <li>issue_tracker@MAIL_DOMAIN
    <br>submissions of issues
    <li>roundup-admin@MAIL_DOMAIN
    <br>roundup's internal use (problems, etc)
</ol>

<em>Note:</em>
We run the instance as group "issue_tracker" and add the mail and web user
("mail" and "apache" on our RedHat 7.1 system) to that group, as well as
any admin people.


<h3><a name="startweb">E-Mail Interface</a></h3>
Set up a mail alias called "issue_tracker" as:
<blockquote>
    <tt>|/usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/roundup-mailgw
        &lt;instance_home&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>

In some installations (e.g. RedHat 6.2 I think) you'll need to set up smrsh
so sendmail will accept the pipe command. In that case, symlink
/etc/smrsh/roundup-mailgw to /usr/local/bin/roundup-mailgw and change the
command to:
<blockquote>
    <tt>|roundup-mailgw &lt;instance_home&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>

To test the mail gateway on unix systems, try:

<blockquote>
    <tt>echo test |mail -s '[issue] test' issue_tracker@your.domain</tt>
</blockquote>



<h3><a name="startweb">Web Interface</a></h3>
This software will work through apache or stand-alone.
<p>
<strong>Stand-alone:</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Edit roundup-server at the top - ROUNDUP_INSTANCE_HOMES needs to know
    about your instance. *** command-line option
    <li><tt>roundup-server [hostname port]</tt>   (hostname may be "")
    <li>Load up the page <tt>/&lt;instance name&gt;/index</tt> where
     instance name is the
     name you nominated in <tt>ROUNDUP_INSTANCE_HOMES</tt>.
*** command-line option
</ol>

<strong>Apache:</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Make sure roundup.cgi is executable. Edit it at the top -
    ROUNDUP_INSTANCE_HOMES needs to know about your instance.
    <li>Edit your <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt> and make sure that the
        <tt>/home/httpd/html/roundup/roundup.cgi</tt> script will be treated as a CGI
    script.
    <li>Add the following to your <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt>:
<pre>
------8<------- snip here ------8<-------
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
RewriteRule ^/roundup/roundup.cgi(.*) /home/httpd/html/roundup/roundup.cgi$1 [e=HTTP_CGI_AUTHORIZATION:%1,t=application/x-httpd-cgi,l]
------8<------- snip here ------8<-------
</pre>
   note: the RewriteRule must be on one line - no breaks
   <li>Re-start your apache to re-load the config
   <li>Load up the page <tt>/roundup/roundup.cgi/&lt;instance name&gt;/index</tt> where
    instance name is the name you nominated in ROUNDUP_INSTANCE_HOMES.
</ol>


<h3><a name="users">Users</a></h3>
To add users, use one of the following interfaces:

<ol>
    <li>On the web, access the URL <tt>.../&lt;instance name&gt;/newuser</tt>
    to bring up a form which may be used to add a new user.
    <li>On the command-line, use:
    <br><tt>roundup-admin -i &lt;instance home&gt; create user
        username=bozo password=bozo address=richard@clown.org</tt>
    <br>Supply the admin username and password. roundup-admin will print the
    id of the new user.
    <li>Any e-mail sent to roundup from an address that doesn't match an
    existing user in the database will result in a new user entry being
    created for that user.
</ol>



<h3><a name="issues">Issues</a></h3>
To add issues, use one of the following interfaces:

<ol>
    <li>On the web, access the URL <tt>.../&lt;instance name&gt;/newissue</tt>
    to bring up a form which may be used to add a new issue.
    <li>On the command-line, use:
    <br><tt>roundup-admin -i &lt;instance home&gt; create issue
        title="test issue"</tt>
    <br>Supply the admin username and password. roundup-admin will print the
    id of the new issue.
    <li>Any e-mail sent to roundup with the subject line containing [issue]
    will automatically created a new issue in the database using the
    contents of the e-mail.
</ol>

<h3><a name="cmd">Command Line Tool</a></h3>

Usage:
<tt>roundup-admin [-i instance home] [-u login] [-c] &lt;command&gt;
    &lt;arguments&gt;</tt>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Commands:
<dd>create classname property=value ...
<dd>find classname propname=value ...
<dd>freshen
<dd>get property designator[,designator]*
<dd>history designator
<dd>init [template [backend [admin password]]]
<dd>list classname [property]
<dd>retire designator[,designator]*
<dd>set designator[,designator]* propname=value ...
<dd>spec classname
<dt>Help:
<dd>roundup-admin -h
<dd>roundup-admin help                       -- this help
<dd>roundup-admin help <command>             -- command-specific help
<dd>roundup-admin morehelp                   -- even more detailed help
<dt>Options:
<dd>-i instance home  -- specify the issue tracker "home directory" to administer
<dd>-u                -- the user[:password] to use for commands
<dd>-c                -- when outputting lists of data, just comma-separate them
</dl>

<p>
All commands (except help) require an instance specifier. This is just the path
to the roundup instance you're working with. A roundup instance is where 
roundup keeps the database and configuration file that defines an issue
tracker. It may be thought of as the issue tracker's "home directory". It may
be specified in the environment variable ROUNDUP_INSTANCE or on the command
line as "-i instance".

<p>
A designator is a classname and a nodeid concatenated, eg. bug1, user10, ...

<p>
Property values are represented as strings in command arguments and in the
printed results:
<ul>
    <li>Strings are, well, strings.
    <li>Date values are printed in the full date format in the local time zone, and
   accepted in the full format or any of the partial formats explained below.
   <li>Link values are printed as node designators. When given as an argument,
   node designators and key strings are both accepted.
   <li>Multilink values are printed as lists of node designators joined by commas.
   When given as an argument, node designators and key strings are both
   accepted; an empty string, a single node, or a list of nodes joined by
   commas is accepted.
</ul>
When multiple nodes are specified to the roundup get or roundup set
commands, the specified properties are retrieved or set on all the listed
nodes. 
<p>
When multiple results are returned by the roundup get or roundup find
commands, they are printed one per line (default) or joined by commas (with
the -c) option. 
<p>
Where the command changes data, a login name/password is required. The
login may be specified as either "name" or "name:password".
<ul>
    <li>ROUNDUP_LOGIN environment variable
    <li>the -u command-line option
</ul>
If either the name or password is not supplied, they are obtained from the
command-line.

<h4>Specific Command help</h4>

<pre>
history:
    Usage: history designator
    Show the history entries of a designator.

    Lists the journal entries for the node identified by the designator.
    
find:
    Usage: find classname propname=value ...
    Find the nodes of the given class with a given property value.

    Find the nodes of the given class with a given property value. The
    value may be either the nodeid of the linked node, or its key value.
    
list:
    Usage: list classname [property]
    List the instances of a class.

    Lists all instances of the given class along. If the property is not
    specified, the  "label" property is used. The label property is tried
    in order: the key, "name", "title" and then the first property,
    alphabetically.
    
retire:
    Usage: retire designator[,designator]*
    Retire the node specified by designator.

    This action indicates that a particular node is not to be retrieved by
    the list or find commands, and its key value may be re-used.
    
create:
    Usage: create classname property=value ...
    Create a new entry of a given class.

    This creates a new entry of the given class using the property
    name=value arguments provided on the command line after the "create"
    command.
    
get:
    Usage: get property designator[,designator]*
    Get the given property of one or more designator(s).

    Retrieves the property value of the nodes specified by the designators.
    
spec:
    Usage: spec classname
    Show the properties for a classname.

    This lists the properties for a given class.
    
set:
    Usage: set designator[,designator]* propname=value ...
    Set the given property of one or more designator(s).

    Sets the property to the value for all designators given.
    
init:
    Usage: init [template [backend [admin password]]]
    Initialise a new Roundup instance.

    The command will prompt for the instance home directory (if not supplied
    through INSTANCE_HOME or the -i option. The template, backend and admin
    password may be specified on the command-line as arguments, in that order.
    
freshen:
    Usage: freshen
    Freshen an existing instance.  **DO NOT USE**

    This currently kills databases!!!!

    This action should generally not be used. It reads in an instance
    database and writes it again. In the future, is may also update
    instance code to account for changes in templates. It's probably wise
    not to use it anyway. Until we're sure it won't break things...

<h3><a name="web">Web Interface</a></h3>
T.B.D.

<h3><a name="mail">E-Mail Gateway</a></h3>

Incoming messages are examined for multiple parts:
<ul>
<li>In a multipart/mixed message or part, each subpart is extracted and
   examined. The text/plain subparts are assembled to form the textual
   body of the message, to be stored in the file associated with a "msg"
   class node. Any parts of other types are each stored in separate files
   and given "file" class nodes that are linked to the "msg" node. 
<li>In a multipart/alternative message or part, we look for a text/plain
   subpart and ignore the other parts.
</ul>

<h4>Summary</h4>
The "summary" property on message nodes is taken from the first non-quoting
section in the message body. The message body is divided into sections by
blank lines. Sections where the second and all subsequent lines begin with
a "&gt;" or "|" character are considered "quoting sections". The first line of
the first non-quoting section becomes the summary of the message. 

<h4>Addresses</h4>
All of the addresses in the To: and Cc: headers of the incoming message are
looked up among the user nodes, and the corresponding users are placed in
the "recipients" property on the new "msg" node. The address in the From:
header similarly determines the "author" property of the new "msg"
node. The default handling for addresses that don't have corresponding
users is to create new users with no passwords and a username equal to the
address. (The web interface does not permit logins for users with no
passwords.) If we prefer to reject mail from outside sources, we can simply
register an auditor on the "user" class that prevents the creation of user
nodes with no passwords. 

<h4>Actions</h4>
The subject line of the incoming message is examined to determine whether
the message is an attempt to create a new item or to discuss an existing
item. A designator enclosed in square brackets is sought as the first thing
on the subject line (after skipping any "Fwd:" or "Re:" prefixes). 

If an item designator (class name and id number) is found there, the newly
created "msg" node is added to the "messages" property for that item, and
any new "file" nodes are added to the "files" property for the item. 

If just an item class name is found there, we attempt to create a new item
of that class with its "messages" property initialized to contain the new
"msg" node and its "files" property initialized to contain any new "file"
nodes. 

<h4>Triggers</h4>
Both cases may trigger detectors (in the first case we are calling the
set() method to add the message to the item's spool; in the second case we
are calling the create() method to create a new node). If an auditor raises
an exception, the original message is bounced back to the sender with the
explanatory message given in the exception.
