  documentation.

Changing HTML layout

  Note changes to the files in html take place immediatly without
  restart, even when running roundup-server.



Q: Displaying messages not only the summary

A: in instance/html/msg.index 

  change
    <td><display call="plain('summary')"></td>
  to
    <td><pre><display call="plain('content')"></pre></td>

  displays the whole message not only the first line and <pre>
  prevents the browser from reformatting. 



Q: Getting the nosy list picker instead of textfield.

  In classic template there is plenty of space below the text field.

A: in instance/html/issue.item

  At the file top set border=1 to see cell boundaries.

  replace
    <td class="form-text"><display call="field('nosy',size=20)"></td>
  by
    <td rowspan=5 class="form-text"><display call="menu('nosy',height=10)"></td>

  remove the last cell in the next four rows, either by deleting a cell
  or by reducing colspan.



Q: I wanted to see the issue id (the number) on the issue item display:

A:
  In file INSTANCE/html/issue.item change, showed e.g. "(anonymous)"
    <td class="form-text"><display call="reldate('creation', pretty=1)">
        (<display call="plain('creator')">)</td>

  to to see "(
    <td class="form-text"><display call="reldate('creation', pretty=1)">
        (issue<display call="plain('id')"> by <display call="plain('creator')">)</td>

Q: Living without a mailserver.

A: Remove the nosy reactor - delete the file
   <instance home>/detectors/nosyreactor.py
