  NOTE: This is just a grabbag, most of this should go into documentation.

Changing HTML layout

  Note changes to the files in html take place immediatly without
  restart, even when running roundup-server.

  Displaying whole messages not only the summary

    Modify instance/html/msg.index change::

      <td><display call="plain('summary')"></td>

    to::

      <td><pre><display call="plain('content')"></pre></td>

    displays the whole message not only the first line and 'pre'
    prevents the browser from reformatting. 

  Getting the nosy list picker instead of textfield.

    In classic template there is plenty of space below the text field.
    So one could modify instance/html/issue.item to use it.

    At the file top set 'border=1' to see cell boundaries, then
    replace::

      <td class="form-text"><display call="field('nosy',size=20)"></td>
  
    by::

      <td rowspan=5 class="form-text"><display call="menu('nosy',height=10)"></td>

    and remove the last cell in the next four rows, either by deleting a cell
    or by reducing colspan.

  Want to see the issue id (the number) on the issue item display

    The number is really a central information and not an internal one.

    In file INSTANCE/html/issue.item displays the creator, so one could add
    the number to it.::

      <td class="form-text"><display call="reldate('creation', pretty=1)">
          (<display call="plain('creator')">)</td>

    to see::

      <td class="form-text"><display call="reldate('creation', pretty=1)">
          (issue<display call="plain('id')"> by <display call="plain('creator')">)</td>

Installation

  Living without a mailserver.

    Remove the nosy reactor, means delete the file 'INSTANCE/detectors/nosyreactor.py'.

  Rights issues (MISSING)

    Different jobs run under different users.

    * Standalone roundup-server is started by whome ?

    * Running cgi under apache.

    * roundup-mailgw called via .forward from MTA, or running a cron job
      fetching via pop.

    see Troubleshooting.

Troubleshooting

  
  AttributeError: '_roundup_instance_1' module has no attribute 'open'

    Sorry: in html it is not formatted correct.

    For example submitting issues via roundup-mailgw breaks similar to this.::

      Command died with status 1:
      "/usr/local/bin/python /usr/local/bin/roundup-mailgw /home/roundup".
      Command output: Traceback (most recent call last):  
        File "/usr/local/bin/roundup-mailgw", line 178, in ? 
           sys.exit(main(sys.argv))
        File "/usr/local/bin/roundup-mailgw", line 153, in main 
          db = instance.open('admin')
           AttributeError: '_roundup_instance_1' module has no attribute 'open'

    Happens if the user which accesses the instance has no read right
    on 'INSTANCE/dbinit.py' or 'pyc'. 

    If the user has no rights on the 'INSTANCE/db' the mailgw finishes,
    but is, of course, unable to add the message. A notification to
    the roundup-admin is sent, with a longer trace ending in::

      File "/opt/python/lib/python2.2/dbhash.py", line 16, in open
        return bsddb.hashopen(file, flag, mode)
      error: (13, 'Keine Berechtigung')

    Replace 'Keine Berechtigung' by 'Not permitted' or ...

    An easy way to test whether it's a permissions problem, or some other mail
    server configuration problem is to cat an email-formatted text file
    directly to the roundup-mailgw script as the roundup user.::

      cat issue.txt | /usr/local/bin/roundup-mailgw /home/roundup

    If that doesn't raise any errors, the problem is the permissions of the
    MTA.
