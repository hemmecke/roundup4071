2001-10-23 - 0.3.0 pre 3
Feature:
 . MailGW now moves 'unread' to 'chatting' on receiving e-mail for an issue.
 . feature #473127: Filenames. I modified the file.index and htmltemplate
   source so that the filename is used in the link and the creation
   information is displayed.
 Admin Tool (roundup-admin):
  . Interactive mode for running multiple (independant at present) commands.
  . Tabular display of nodes.
  . Import and export via colon-separated files.

Changed:
 . re-organised the html templating code. Fixed some bugs, probably
   introduced some more.  Hopefully not too many.

Fixed:
 . Stand-alone server now has a configurable setuid user.
 . CGI interface wasn't handling checkboxes at all.
 . Fixed quopri usage in mailgw from bug reports on mailing list.
 . Remove the "freshen" command from the roundup-admin tool.
 . Catch errors in login - no username or password supplied.
 . Fixed editing of password (Password property type) thanks Roch'e Compaan.
 . Fixed grouping of non-str properties thanks Roch'e Compaan.
 . bug #473121: The customisation view and filters (CGI interface view
   customisation section may now be hidden (patch from Roch'e Compaan.)
 . bug #473122: Issue id sorting (hyperdb sorts strings-that-look-like-numbers
   as numbers now.
 . bug #473124: UI inconsistency with Link fields.
   This also prompted me to fix a fairly long-standing usability issue -
   that of being able to turn off certain filters.
 . bug #473125: Paragraph in e-mails
 . bug #473126: Sender unknown
 . bug #473130: Nosy list not set correctly


2001-10-11 - 0.3.0 pre 2
Fixed:
 . Hyperdatabase was inserting empty strings instead of None for missing
   property values. This broke a lot of things.


2001-10-10 - 0.3.0 pre 1
Feature:
 . roundup-admin create now prompts for property info if none is supplied
   on the command-line.
 . hyperdb Class getprops() method may now return only the mutable
   properties.
 . CGI interfaces now generate a top-level index of their known instances.

Changed:
 . Login now uses cookies, which makes it a whole lot more flexible. We can
   now support anonymous user access (read-only, unless there's an
   "anonymous" user, in which case write access is permitted). Login
   handling has been moved into cgi_client.Client.main()
 . The "extended" schema is now the default in roundup init.
 . The schemas have had their page headings modified to cope with the new
   login handling. Existing installations should copy the interfaces.py
   file from the roundup lib directory to their instance home.
 . Passwords are now encoded by default (except exising databases which
   will only be encoded when the passwords are changed). The scheme used
   at the moment is SHA - but the code is flexible enough to take any
   number of encoding systems.
 . The roundup-admin tool always operates as the "admin" user now. Database
   protection should be achieved using file system protections (see the
   documentation for details.)

Fixed:
 . Incorrectly had a Bizar Software copyright on the cgitb.py module from
   Ping - has been removed.
 . Pretty time interval wasn't handling > 1 month properly.
 . Generation of links to Link/Multilink in indexes. (thanks Hubert Hoegl)
 . AssignedTo wasn't in the "classic" schema's item page.
 . Fixed a whole bunch of places in the CGI interface where we should have
   been returning Not Found instead of throwing an exception.
 . Fixed a deviation from the spec: trying to modify the 'id' property of
   an item now throws an exception.
 . The plain() template function now html-escapes the content.
 . Change message was stuffing up for multilinks with no key property.



--------------

2001-08-30 - 0.2.8
Fixed:
 . Wasn't handling unguessable mime types for file uploads.
 . Missing import in mailgw.


2001-08-29 - 0.2.7
Feature:
 . Text searches are now case insensitive. All forms of text search use
   regular expressions now.

Fixed:
 . Had another 2.1-ism in the unit tests
 . Made the mail parser a little more robust w.r.t missing Subject:
   (both thanks Mikhail Sobolev)
 . Missed some isFooType usages (thanks Mikhail Sobolev for spotting them)
 . Reverted back to sending change messages to the web editor of a node so
   that the change note message is actually genrated.
 . CGI interface wasn't generating correct change messages.
 . Notes entered during a change are saved to the messages list even if
   there's no nosy list. No message is generated if there's no nosy list and
   there's no change note (since it would just duplicates the journal).
 . Completely removed the bsddb3 module from the tests - will be reinstated
   when the http://bsddb.sourceforge.net/'s bugs #439959 and #456408 are
   dealt with. One is fixed in CVS, the other pending.


2001-08-08 - 0.2.6
Note:
 . Roundup is now released under the same terms as the Python License.

Feature:
 . Added tests for instance initialisation. No more releasing the software
   with bugs in roundup.init!
 . Now bundling unittest with the package so that python 2.0 users can use
   the tests.
 . Much better error handling and messages generated by the mail gateway.

Fixed:
 . Implemented correct mail splitting. Added unit tests. Also snips
   signatures now too.
 . Bug #447671 - typo in roundup/init.py
 . Changed date.Date to use regular string formatting instead of strftime -
   win32 seems to have problems with %T and no hour... or something...
 . Bug #448484 - now catching correct exception from makedirs.
 . Instances are now opened by a special function that generates a unique
   module name for the instances on import time.


2001-08-03 - 0.2.5
Note:
 . The bsddb3 module has a bug that renders it non-functional. Users should
   select the anydbm or bsddb backend instead.

Fixed:
 . Python 2.0 does not contain the unittest module. The setup.py module now
   checks for unittest before attempting to run the unit tests.


2001-08-03 - 0.2.4
Features:
 . Added ability for cgi newblah forms to indicate that the new node
   should be linked somewhere.
 . Added time logging and file uploading to the templates.
 . Added "My Issues" and "My Support" to extended template. Changed "Your
   Details" to "My Details". Changed the "New Foo" links to "Add Foo".
   Added links for unassigned support and issues. Generally reorganised and
   cleanup the header up.
 . Changed the order of the information in the message generated by web edits.
 . Extended the range of intervals that are pretty-printed before actual dates
   are displayed.
 . Added more BUILD instructions including the "clean" command to force
   rebuild.
 . Web edit messages aren't sent to the person who did the edit any more. No
   message is generated if they are the only person on the nosy list.
 . Roundupdb now appends "mailing list" information to its messages which
   include the e-mail address and web interface address. Templates may
   override this in their db classes to include specific information (support
   instructions, etc).

Fixed:
 . Argument handling for the roundup-admin find command.
 . Handling of summary when no note supplied for newblah. Again.
 . Detection of no form in htmltemplate Field display.
 . Checklist html template command was setting wrong name.
 . 2.1-specific gmtime() (no arg) call in roundup.date. (thanks Paul Wright)
 . mailgw was making naughty assumptions about the schema of the classes it
   was creating nodes for.
 . remove the $Foo$ from the HTML files stored in the htmlbase modules.
 . Instance import now imports the instance using imp.load_module so that
   we can have instance homes of "roundup" or other existing python package
   names.


2001-07-30 - 0.2.3
Big change:
 . I've split off the support class from the issue class in "extended".
   Anyone who has any support entries, sorry. It should be possible to
   write a scipt that moves the entries over pretty easily. If this causes
   you pain, I'll do so. You'll want to update your instance with the new
   code in "extended" either way.

Features:
 . Added the unit tests to the start of setup.py so they're run whenever
   we do anything distutils'y.
 . Added nicer prompting to the roundup-admin "init" command.
 . Actually, the roundup-admin code is totally revamped, and has command
   help and better command-line arg handling.
 . The cgi_client.Client base class now reflects the structure of "classic"
   rather than "extended" since "classic" is more of a "base" template.
 . Added more DB to test. Skips tests where imports fail.

Fixed:
 . One of the tests in test_date had the wrong expected result.
 . Fixed IssueClass so that superseders links to its classname rather than
   hard-coded to "issue".
 . templatebuilder was catching IOError instead of OSError.
 . The cgi_client newblah method wasn't detecting the __note form field
   properly.
 . The History command in htmltemplate didn't handle a new node (None
   nodeid) properly.


2001-07-29 - 0.2.2
Features:
 . Added implementation.txt to the doc directory. Contains implementation
   notes specific to this implementations of Roundup.
 . Cleaned up mailgw some (subclass Message for getPart) and added some
   tests for multipart splitting.
 . Better checking for html dir in templatebuilder.
 . Base hyperdb.Class now fakes the "id" property.
 . Made the classic roundup look more like the original prototype.
 . Made cgi_client and templating slightly more generic.
 . Moved some code around in cgi_client allowing for subclassing to change
   behaviour.
 . Added the fabricated property "id" to all hyperdb classes.
 . Cleanup of the link label generation (new method on hyperdb.Class to do
   it).

Fixed:
 . Everything uses errno module now to check errno values.
 . New issue form handles lack of note better now.
 . HTML templating uses section-bar style for index group headers now.
 . Fixed problem in link display when Link value is None.
 . Form handling in cgi client wasn't propogating through the previous
   query elements.
 . Fixed sort arguments generated for column headings so sorting can be
   changed now.


2001-07-28 - 0.2.1
Features:
 . Added docstring to roundup package so pydoc reports useful information.
 . Added the roundup 1 software carpentry submission HTML to the doc
   directory as "overview.html".

Fixes:
 . Fixed bug in init command - templatebuilder was assuming existence of
   "html" directory in instance home.
 . Fixed INSTALL.txt to reflect some changes in the installation and test
   procedure. Whatdya know, "setup.py install" does the script install.
   There you go...
 . Fixed some non-string node ids in cgi_client now that the hyperdb is
   strict about such things.

2001-07-26 - 0.2.0
Features:
 . Major reorganisation of code to allow multiple roundup instances and a
   single, site-packages -based installation. Also allows multiple database
   back-ends.
 . Moved the bin/ proggies into the top dir, so that it all works
   out-of-the-box
 . Added the "classic" template - a direct implementation of the Roundup
   spec. Well, as close as we're going to get, anyway.
 . Added an issue priority of support to "extended"
 . Added command-line arg handling to roundup-server so it's more useful 
   out-of-the-box.
 . Added distutils-style installation of "lib" files.
 . Added some unit tests.

Fixes:
 . Fixed bug in re generation in the filter
 . Fixed handling of None String property in grouped list headings
 . Fixed adding new issue with no change note
 . Fixed values in text input fields which contained quotes (") are now
   quoted.
 . Fixed a bug in the hyperdb filter - wrong variable names in the error
   message.

2001-07-19 - 0.1.3
 . Reldate now takes an argument "pretty" - when true, it pretty-prints the
   interval generated up to 5 days, then pretty-prints the date of last
   activity. The issue index and item now use the pretty format.
 . Classes list for admin user in CGI interface.
 . Made the view configuration more accessible, neater and more realistic.
 . Fixed list view grouping handling grouping by a Multilink or String or Link
   value of None or Date, ...  (mind you, sorting by Date???)
 . Fixed bug in the plain formatter when a Link was None.
 . Fixed ordering of list view column headings.
 . Fixed list view column heading sort links - and limited the number of
   columns to sort by to 2.
 . Added searching by glob to StringType filtering -
    ^text  - search for text at start of fields
    text$  - search for text at end of fields
    ^text$ - exactly match text in fields
    te*xt  - search for text matching "te"<any characters>"xt"
    te?xt  - search for text matching "te"<any one character>"xt"
 . Added more fields to the issue.filter and issue.index templates


2001-07-18 - 0.1.2
 . Set default index to ?:group=priority&:columns=activity,status,title so
   the priority column isn't displayed.
 . Thanks Anthony:
   . added notes to the README about Python prerequisites
   . added check to roundup.py, roundup.cgi, server.py and roundup-mailgw.py
     for python 2+ - and made the file itself parseable by 1.5.2 ;)
   . python 2.0 didn't have the default args for the time module functions.
   . better handling of db directory in initDB
 . Sorting on the extra properties defined by roundupdb classes was broken
   due to the caching used. May now sort on activity and creation
   properties, etc.
 . Set the default index to sort on activity


2001-07-18 - 0.1.1
 . Initial version release with consent of Roundup spec author, Ka-Ping Yee:
   "Amazing!  Nice work.  I'll watch for the source code on your website."

2001-07-11 - 0.1.0
 . Needed a bug tracking system. Looked around. Tried to install many
   Perl-based systems, to no avail. Got tired of waiting for Roundup to be
   released. Had just finished major product project, so needed something
   different for a while. Roundup here I come...
