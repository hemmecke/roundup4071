This file contains the changes to the Roundup system over time. The entries
are given with the most recent entry first.

2001-08-?? - 0.2.3
Big change:
 . I've split off the support class from the issue class in "extended".
   Anyone who has any support entries, sorry. It should be possible to
   write a scipt that moves the entries over pretty easily. If this causes
   you pain, I'll do so. You'll want to update your instance with the new
   code in "extended" either way.

Features:
 . Added the unit tests to the start of setup.py so they're run whenever
   we do anything distutils'y.
 . Added nicer prompting to the roundup-admin "init" command.
 . Actually, the roundup-admin code is totally revamped, and has command
   help and better command-line arg handling.
 . The cgi_client.Client base class now reflects the structure of "classic"
   rather than "extended" since "classic" is more of a "base" template.

Fixed:
 . One of the tests in test_date had the wrong expected result.
 . Fixed IssueClass so that superseders links to its classname rather than
   hard-coded to "issue".
 . templatebuilder was catching IOError instead of OSError.
 . The cgi_client newblah method wasn't detecting the __note form field
   properly.
 . The History command in htmltemplate didn't handle a new node (None
   nodeid) properly.


2001-07-29 - 0.2.2
Features:
 . Added implementation.txt to the doc directory. Contains implementation
   notes specific to this implementations of Roundup.
 . Cleaned up mailgw some (subclass Message for getPart) and added some
   tests for multipart splitting.
 . Better checking for html dir in templatebuilder.
 . Base hyperdb.Class now fakes the "id" property.
 . Made the classic roundup look more like the original prototype.
 . Made cgi_client and templating slightly more generic.
 . Moved some code around in cgi_client allowing for subclassing to change
   behaviour.
 . Added the fabricated property "id" to all hyperdb classes.
 . Cleanup of the link label generation (new method on hyperdb.Class to do
   it).

Fixed:
 . Everything uses errno module now to check errno values.
 . New issue form handles lack of note better now.
 . HTML templating uses section-bar style for index group headers now.
 . Fixed problem in link display when Link value is None.
 . Form handling in cgi client wasn't propogating through the previous
   query elements.
 . Fixed sort arguments generated for column headings so sorting can be
   changed now.


2001-07-28 - 0.2.1
Features:
 . Added docstring to roundup package so pydoc reports useful information.
 . Added the roundup 1 software carpentry submission HTML to the doc
   directory as "overview.html".

Fixes:
 . Fixed bug in init command - templatebuilder was assuming existence of
   "html" directory in instance home.
 . Fixed INSTALL.txt to reflect some changes in the installation and test
   procedure. Whatdya know, "setup.py install" does the script install.
   There you go...
 . Fixed some non-string node ids in cgi_client now that the hyperdb is
   strict about such things.

2001-07-26 - 0.2.0
Features:
 . Major reorganisation of code to allow multiple roundup instances and a
   single, site-packages -based installation. Also allows multiple database
   back-ends.
 . Moved the bin/ proggies into the top dir, so that it all works
   out-of-the-box
 . Added the "classic" template - a direct implementation of the Roundup
   spec. Well, as close as we're going to get, anyway.
 . Added an issue priority of support to "extended"
 . Added command-line arg handling to roundup-server so it's more useful 
   out-of-the-box.
 . Added distutils-style installation of "lib" files.
 . Added some unit tests.

Fixes:
 . Fixed bug in re generation in the filter
 . Fixed handling of None String property in grouped list headings
 . Fixed adding new issue with no change note
 . Fixed values in text input fields which contained quotes (") are now
   quoted.
 . Fixed a bug in the hyperdb filter - wrong variable names in the error
   message.

2001-07-19 - 0.1.3
 . Reldate now takes an argument "pretty" - when true, it pretty-prints the
   interval generated up to 5 days, then pretty-prints the date of last
   activity. The issue index and item now use the pretty format.
 . Classes list for admin user in CGI interface.
 . Made the view configuration more accessible, neater and more realistic.
 . Fixed list view grouping handling grouping by a Multilink or String or Link
   value of None or Date, ...  (mind you, sorting by Date???)
 . Fixed bug in the plain formatter when a Link was None.
 . Fixed ordering of list view column headings.
 . Fixed list view column heading sort links - and limited the number of
   columns to sort by to 2.
 . Added searching by glob to StringType filtering -
    ^text  - search for text at start of fields
    text$  - search for text at end of fields
    ^text$ - exactly match text in fields
    te*xt  - search for text matching "te"<any characters>"xt"
    te?xt  - search for text matching "te"<any one character>"xt"
 . Added more fields to the issue.filter and issue.index templates


2001-07-18 - 0.1.2
 . Set default index to ?:group=priority&:columns=activity,status,title so
   the priority column isn't displayed.
 . Thanks Anthony:
   . added notes to the README about Python prerequisites
   . added check to roundup.py, roundup.cgi, server.py and roundup-mailgw.py
     for python 2+ - and made the file itself parseable by 1.5.2 ;)
   . python 2.0 didn't have the default args for the time module functions.
   . better handling of db directory in initDB
 . Sorting on the extra properties defined by roundupdb classes was broken
   due to the caching used. May now sort on activity and creation
   properties, etc.
 . Set the default index to sort on activity


2001-07-18 - 0.1.1
 . Initial version release with consent of Roundup spec author, Ka-Ping Yee:
   "Amazing!  Nice work.  I'll watch for the source code on your website."

2001-07-11 - 0.1.0
 . Needed a bug tracking system. Looked around. Tried to install many
   Perl-based systems, to no avail. Got tired of waiting for Roundup to be
   released. Had just finished major product project, so needed something
   different for a while. Roundup here I come...
