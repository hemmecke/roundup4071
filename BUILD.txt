Building Releases
=================

Roundup is currently a source-only release - it has no binary components. I
want it to stay that way, too.

This means that we only need to ever build source releases. This is done by
running:

1. Make sure the unit tests run! "./run_tests"
2. Edit roundup/__init__.py and doc/announcement.txt to reflect the new
   version and appropriate announcements. Add truncated announcement to
   setup.py description field.
3. python setup.py clean --all
4. Edit setup.py to ensure that all information therein (version, contact
   information etc) is correct.
5. python setup.py sdist --manifest-only
6. Check the MANIFEST to make sure that any new files are included. If
   they are not, edit MANIFEST.in to include them. "Documentation" for
   MANIFEST.in may be found in disutils.filelist._parse_template_line.
7. python setup.py sdist
   (if you find sdist a little verbose, add "--quiet" to the end of the
    command)

So, those commands in a nice, cut'n'pasteable form::

 python setup.py clean --all
 python setup.py sdist --manifest-only
 python setup.py sdist --quiet
 python2.3 setup.py register


Distributing Releases
=====================

Once a release is built, follow these steps:

1. FTP the tar.gz from the dist directory to to the "incoming" directory on
   "upload.sourceforge.net".
2. Make a quick release at:
    http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/qrs.php?package_id=&group_id=31577
3. Add a news item at:
    https://sourceforge.net/news/submit.php?group_id=31577
   using the top of doc/announcement.txt
4. Send doc/announcement.txt to python-announce@python.org
5. Notify any other news services as appropriate...
