                                    Roundup
                                    =======

1. Building Releases
====================

Roundup is currently a source-only release - it has no binary components. I
want it to stay that way, too.

This means that we only need to ever build source releases. This is done by
running:

  0. python setup.py clean --all
  1. Edit setup.py to ensure that all information therein (version, contact
     information etc) is correct.
  2. python setup.py sdist --manifest-only
  3. Check the MANIFEST to make sure that any new files are included. If
     they are not, edit MANIFEST.in to include them. "Documentation" for
     MANIFEST.in may be found in disutils.filelist._parse_template_line.
  4. python setup.py sdist
     (if you find sdist a little verbose, add "--quiet" to the end of the
      command)
  5. FTP the tar.gz from the dist directory to to the "incoming" directory on
     "upload.sourceforge.net".
  6. Make a quick release at:
      http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/qrs.php?package_id=&group_id=31577

So, those commands in a nice, cut'n'pasteable form :)
python setup.py clean --all
python setup.py sdist --manifest-only
python setup.py sdist --quiet
