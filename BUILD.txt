                                    =======

1. Building Releases
====================

Roundup is currently a source-only release - it has no binary components. I
want it to stay that way, too.

This means that we only need to ever build source releases. This is done by
running:

  0. Edit setup.py and doc/announcement.txt to reflect the new version and
     appropriate announcments.
  1. python setup.py clean --all
  2. Edit setup.py to ensure that all information therein (version, contact
     information etc) is correct.
  3. python setup.py sdist --manifest-only
  4. Check the MANIFEST to make sure that any new files are included. If
     they are not, edit MANIFEST.in to include them. "Documentation" for
     MANIFEST.in may be found in disutils.filelist._parse_template_line.
  5. python setup.py sdist
     (if you find sdist a little verbose, add "--quiet" to the end of the
      command)

So, those commands in a nice, cut'n'pasteable form :)
python setup.py clean --all
python setup.py sdist --manifest-only
python setup.py sdist --quiet

or, for the sad RedHat users:
python2 setup.py clean --all
python2 setup.py sdist --manifest-only
python2 setup.py sdist --quiet


2. Distributing Releases
========================

Once a release is built, follow these steps:
  1. FTP the tar.gz from the dist directory to to the "incoming" directory on
     "upload.sourceforge.net".
  2. Make a quick release at:
      http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/qrs.php?package_id=&group_id=31577
  3. Add a news item at:
      https://sourceforge.net/news/submit.php?group_id=31577
     using the top of doc/announcement.txt
  4. Send doc/announcement.txt to python-announce@python.org
  5. Notify any other news services as appropriate...
